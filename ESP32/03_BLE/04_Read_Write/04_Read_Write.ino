/*

Code Summary by ChatGPT :
This program establishes a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) connection between an ESP32 microcontroller and a smartphone. 
It performs the following:

1. BLE Server Setup:
  The ESP32 acts as a BLE server with two characteristics:
    TX (Notify): Sends sensor data to the smartphone.
    RX (Write): Receives commands from the smartphone.

2. BME280 Sensor Integration:
  The ESP32 reads environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude) from the BME280 sensor.
  This data is sent to the smartphone as JSON via the TX characteristic.

3. LED Control:
  The smartphone can send "ON" or "OFF" commands via the RX characteristic to control an LED connected to GPIO pin 2.

4. BLE Communication:
  The ESP32 advertises the BLE service, allowing the smartphone to connect and interact with it.
  This program demonstrates a combination of BLE communication and sensor data transmission for IoT applications.
